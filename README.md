# Dune-1984


As a big fan of [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s famous Dune novels and its gorgeous cinematic transposition of [**Dune**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)(1984) written and directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), i developed this theme to create a pleasant environment for my PKM activities in Obsidian.

This theme offers many features to organize your documents with reworked notes, callouts, custom tables.
Stilistic elements for poetry and various decorations add a particular touch to your documents, pictures can be customized in a variety of ways.

Printing (**Export as PDF**) incorporates all features added by this theme, dark themes preserve their overall color scheme, save for dark backgrounds which will be printed in white.
**Slide** is a core plugin of Obsidian to create slideshows on-the-fly. Now this interface is bigger, less cluttered and incorporates all features added by this theme
  
Particular attention has got the **phone interface**, the overall look is more compact and most features implemented in the desktop version work technically speaking, for phones as well.
You will get more space on-screen, better bigger buttons easier to spot and an improved haptic feeback for a better flow.

My main goal to design **Dune** was to get a clean, clutter-free experience and therefore most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). With **Style Settings** installed, you can re-enable everything hidden, if you need to do so.
