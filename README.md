# Dune84

(buy coffe)

As a big fan of [Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s famous "Dune" novels and its gorgeous cinematic transposition of [Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)(1984) written and directed by David Lynch, i developed this theme to create a pleasant environment for my PKM activities in Obsidian.

This installation offers many features to organize your documents with reworked notes, callouts, custom tables.
Stilistic elements for poetry and various decorations add a particular touch to your documents, pictures can be customized in a variety of ways.
Printing (Export as PDF) incorporates all features added by this theme, dark themes will preserve their overall color scheme at exception for dark backgrounds, which will be printed in white.

Particular attention has gotten the smartphone interface, the overall look is more compact, some buttons are slightly bigger for easier haptic feeback and most features implemented in the desktop version work for smartphones as well. 

The interface was designed to be clean, clutter-free and therefore most buttons are semi-hidden away by default. With Style Settings installed, you can re-enable visibility of buttons and tabs if desired.
