# Customize Folders

This snippet is an extension of Dune, because this way you get the chance to display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
To add this snippet, download [folder-icons.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons.css), then [install folder-icons.css](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets) before you change anything in Obsidian. 
To get started, pick a random keyword listed below for a quick test (keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/"): 

- Workbench
- Journal / Training / Education
- Design / Draft
- Read
- Project
- Responsibility / Area
- Resources
- Archive
- Portfolio
- Photo
- Software / Linux / Mac / Win
- Entertainment / Movie
- Study / Research
- Contact
- Society / Social
- Health
- Network
- Travel
- Sport
- Language
- Code / Shell
- Game

**TIP:** to add colors and icons to your folders, use this name scheme, eg. `1 Project`
